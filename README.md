## About

_How do good books start? What are the first words that open up an entirely new universe? You're about to find out._ ðŸ¤“

I'm using [OpenLibrary's API](https://openlibrary.org/developers/api) to retrive all first sentences of an author's books. The result is a little search app that will display a list of all first sentences, given an author's name.

I've used [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) as a starting point.

## Scripts

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
